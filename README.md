# Database Implementation :Custom Workout Playlist Generator
The following chapter describes the the selection of databases, libraries and instructions to setup the requirements needed for the Custom Workout Playlist Generator. 



## ðŸ”— Dependencies and Setup

Following tools and libraries are required for setting up the database for the Custom Workout Playlist Generator. Note that the steps in this section listed below is designed as a guide for you to manually setup the database. If you wish to skip these steps and directly create the database, tables and dummy data, jump to the installing MySql step and follow the next section titled **Flask app setup.**

```

[![MySQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-005C84?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white)](https://www.mysql.com/downloads/)

MySQL was chosen as a database for the project because it's free to use, widely used, and performs well with large amounts of data. It's easy to scale up as projects grow and works with many programming languages. Plus, it's secure and stable, making it a reliable option for important tasks.

- [x]  install MySQL communuty edition from [here](https://www.mysql.com/products/community/)
- [x]  When prompted for the credentials duting the installation wizard, use the **username root  and password root.** if you wish to use a different credentials, make sure to update the modified credentials when runng the app.py in the next section. 
- [x]  Configre the MySQL server to run on your OS with your credentials.



#Database Setup  (Flask App and Environment Setup)

If you have skipped the manual setup to install the required libraries, you can use the **Requirements.txt** file to install the nessacery libraries. 

- [x]  We recommend you use a Python Virtual Environment for setting-up the next steps.
- [x]  Create a folder of your choosing for the virtual Environment
- [x]  Clone our repo to the folder
- [x]  Use the folder path to create the Virtual Environment
```bash
python3 -m venv /path/to/the/virtualenv
```
- [x]  Activate the Virtual Environment

```bash
c:\path\to\the\virtualenv\Scripts\activate.bat
on OSX
source /path/to/the/virtualenv/bin/activate
```
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- [x]  Run the flask App. this will create all the tables and relationships in your environment. make sure to change the password install to the database url if you have used a password of your own.
```python
app.config["SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_BASE_URI"] = "mysql+mysqldb://root@localhost/"
```
```bash
python .\app.py
```
- [x] To add sample data to the tables, you can run the provided sql dump using the following command.

```bash
use workout_playlists
source /path/to/sql/your_sql_file.sql
```
