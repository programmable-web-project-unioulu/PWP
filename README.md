## Usage
### Installing dependencies
0. (Install virtualenv)
(virtualenv is not in requirements)
(in case with problems on Windows, try first installing with)
```shell
python -m pip install virtualenv --user
```

1. Activate python virtual environment in command line
```shell
virtualenv pwp
```

2. Activate virtual environment
```shell
pwp\Scripts\activate.bat
```
3. install dependencies
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. start the API
```shell
flask run
```
## Test the API
Run apitest and db_test with pytest in the root folder.
Configure it to check both app.py and src folder.
To do this:
```shell
pytest --cov=app --cov=src
```
## Tests
### db_test
```shell
pytest db_test.py
```
This command will test CRUD operations in each model.
In addition, uniqueness of the date will be tested.
The tests will also check that the headline and the modification date are not null.
### api_test
```shell
pytest api_test.py
```
This command will test the API methods for each resource.
(At the moment it tests only user)
