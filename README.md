# Pre-commit

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to ensure code quality.

```shell
# Install pre-commit with pip
pip3 install pre-commit
# Run this to initialize pre-commit in the repo
cd /path/to/repo
pre-commit install
```

# Development

This repository is a monorepo, containing all needed components for the course.

API directory contains the flask backend.

# Usage

Easiest way to get this up and running is to use podman/docker:

```shell
# create .env file in the root directory
touch .env
# fill in the details as such
DB_PASSWORD=<username>
DB_USER=<password>

podman-compose up -d
# Or docker
docker compose up -d

# then make requests to localhost:3000
curl -X GET localhost:3000
```

# Examine database contents with adminer

Navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and login with the above details. Server should be _'db'_ and database should be _'postgres'_.
