    A convenience class for managing dictionaries that represent Mason
    objects. It provides nice shorthands for inserting some of the more
    elements into the object but mostly is just a parent for the much more
    useful subclass defined next. This class is generic in the sense that it
    does not contain any application specific implementation details.

    Note that child classes should set the *DELETE_RELATION* to the application
    specific relation name from the application namespace. The IANA standard
    does not define a link relation for deleting something.
