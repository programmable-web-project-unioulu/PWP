# Meetings notes

## Meeting 1.
* **DATE: 2024-02-07**
* **ASSISTANTS: Iván Sánchez Milara**

### Minutes
*In the meeting we went through the Deadline 1 description about our API and concepts/design in person. All team members were present at the meeting. The API overview was fine, but main concepts's diagram was wrong type. API uses needed more explanation related to the second client: dashboard. Auxiliary service needed more context as we had forgotten to mention our use of SMS in the project. Related work needed more clarification regarding Smart Campus and needed another example of related works.*

### Action points
*We discussed about the "MökkiWahti" and the following key action points were raised during the meeting*
- "Keep it simple", had too many features/functionalities.
- Provided diagram was about the system architecture, not data/concept relations.
- Explain about the second client: dashboard (visualizing data required)
  - Auxiliry service needed explaining (eg. SMS thing) 
- Related work: Smart Campus
  - Smart Campus didn't use DELETE or PUT, while "not uniform Interface" uses POST and DELETE.
  - Would need to explain more about the Smart Campus.
  - Explaining about the client was lacking.
